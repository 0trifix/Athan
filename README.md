# Athan

Athan is a Python program that displays prayer times and sends notifications based on the user's location. This project aims to help me and my fellow Muslims be on time for their prayers.

## Goals

My goals with this project are to learn more about Git(GitHub) and improve my programming skills. I have only done smaller projects before and never really had something to proudly show off. With Athan, I hope to create something useful for my community.

## Features

- Retrieves the current location (latitude and longitude) using an IP address.
- Obtains prayer times for the current month based on the location.
- Displays today's prayer times.
- Sends notifications for each prayer at the appropriate time.
