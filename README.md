# Athan

This is my first "official" poject, I hope to learn a lot from this.

## Goals
My goals with this project are to firstly learn more about git(hub) and learn more about programming, I've only done smaller projects and never really had something that I could proudly show off.
I hope that with Athan I can help my fellow Muslims be on time for their prayer and never miss another one.
As this is my first time trying something like this I do not know if it will work perfectly, I will try my best and add any info as time goes on.
