# Athan

This is my first "official" poject, I hope to learn a lot from this.

## Goals
My goals with this project are to firstly learn more about git(hub) and learn more about programming, I've only done smaller projects and never really had something that I could proudly show off.
I hope that with Athan I can help my fellow Muslims be on time for their prayer and never miss another one.
As this is my first time trying something like this I do not know if it will work perfectly, I will try my best and add any info as time goes on.

## Progress
At the moment I've been succesfull in implementing the API's to get the needed latitude and longitude and using these to get the prayertimes.
What needs to be done is extract the prayertimes out of the json and displaying them in a readable way, after that I'll need to implement a way to either get a notification on the screen or make the athan play when it's time for prayer.
